          <p>Hi, <br><br> I’d like to tell you about the ‘us’ behind NW Natural Soap and how the company came about.</p>
          <p>It all started with plans to provide a team of coworkers a gift of knitted spa cloths and handmade soap.  I could knit the spa cloths, but what soap to buy?  Searching for the ‘just right’ soap proved elusive.  There are many good, quality products available, but none seemed to be what I was looking for.</p>
          <p>As I searched I became convinced I could make quality soap using natural ingredients for optimized therapeutic benefits rather than purchasing one of the many soaps already available.  I could then influence the healthful benefits included in the soap.  And I like my team enough to want to maximize the healthful benefits!  For my first foray into soap making, my gifts were surprisingly well-received with much encouragement to make more soap.  I also received some good constructive feedback on what to improve.</p>
          <p>Researching, gathering ingredients and poring over various adaptations of recipes helped me to realize I could make quality soap at a good price for those who want natural skin and hair products.  I also wanted to take advantage of my 35+ years of experience as a Registered Nurse to ensure the products provided maximum health benefits.  Having administered transdermal patches (examples:  scopolamine for motion sickness, nicotine patches to stop smoking, fentanyl for analgesia, nitroglycerin for angina) through the years to patients, I know absorption via the skin can influence (positively or negatively) the internal organs.  So why not put good, healthful products on your skin?</p>
          <p>After many hours and numerous iterations, I’ve created the base products of our business.  The requirement was to create an all-natural product with minimal ingredients and maximum benefit that provides a pleasant skin care experience.</p>
          <p>I’m in the evaluation phase for currently available products.  Based on feedback, I will adapt the recipes as needed to improve our soaps and determine what my customers want.</p>
          <p>Now, more about the rest of ‘us’:</p>
          <p>Bob (husband) serves as our business manager and web developer, <br> Ian (son) manages our social media presence, <br> Tom (son) oversees our marketing and new product development.</P>
          <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>
          <p>Regards,<br>Sue</p>
